# Playwright Automation example
The purpose of this project is to showcase what playwright can do, and how I organized it.
This project retrieves the top 10 posts and information about them. This is just a small window into what automation can do.

### How to run
in the directory of 'y-combinator-playwright-demo' run:

npm install

then run:

npx playwright test


The above command will run the tests, and will populate the posts.csv file with relevant up to date data.
